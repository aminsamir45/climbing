  - Precise foot placement
  - Smearing practice
  - Heel hooks and toe hooks

### Priority 3: Body Positioning
- **Drills**:
  - Flagging (inside/outside)
  - Back stepping
  - Twisting and turning
  - Center of gravity management

### Priority 4: Slab Climbing
- **Approach**:

  - Practice weight distribution
  - Gradually increase difficulty

## Progression Guidelines

### When to Progress
- **Hangboard**: When you can complete all sets with good form, add 5 lbs
- **Climbing**: When you can send 3+ V6 problems consistently, start projecting V7
- **Strength**: When you can complete all reps with good form, add weight or reps

### Warning Signs (Back Off)
- Persistent finger pain
- Elbow/shoulder pain
- Excessive fatigue
- Poor sleep quality
- Decreased motivation

## Monthly Assessment

### Test Every 4 Weeks
1. **Finger Strength**: Max hang weight on 20mm edge
2. **Pull Strength**: Max weighted pull-up
3. **Climbing Level**: Hardest problem sent
4. **Technique**: Self-assessment on movement quality

### Adjust Based on Results
- If progressing well: Continue plan
- If plateauing: Adjust volume/intensity
- If regressing: Deload week, reassess
