# Coaching Notes & Key Concepts

## Understanding Periodization

### What is Periodization?
Periodization is the systematic planning of training to optimize performance and prevent overtraining. It involves varying training volume, intensity, and focus over time.

### Why It Matters
- **Prevents Plateaus**: Constant variation prevents adaptation
- **Reduces Injury Risk**: Planned recovery prevents overuse
- **Optimizes Performance**: Peaks at the right time
- **Maintains Motivation**: Variety keeps training interesting

### Basic Structure
1. **Macrocycle**: Long-term goal (e.g., 12-16 weeks to V10)
2. **Mesocycle**: Medium-term phase (e.g., 4-week blocks)
3. **Microcycle**: Weekly structure
4. **Deload**: Recovery week every 4th week

## Training Principles

### 1. Specificity
- Train what you want to improve
- Climbing-specific training > general fitness
- But maintain base fitness (running)

### 2. Progressive Overload
- Gradually increase difficulty
- Add weight, increase volume, or improve intensity
- Small increments (5-10% increases)

### 3. Recovery
- Growth happens during recovery, not training
- Sleep is non-negotiable (aim for 7-9 hours)
- Deload weeks are essential
- Listen to your body

### 4. Individualization
- This plan is a template
- Adjust based on your response
- What works for others may not work for you

### 5. Consistency
- Better to train 3x/week consistently than 6x/week sporadically
- Missed sessions happen - don't try to make up for them
- Long-term consistency > short-term intensity

## Understanding Your Weaknesses

### Technique Issues
**Why It Matters**: 
- Good technique = efficient movement = less energy expended
- Allows you to use strength more effectively
- Prevents injury

**How to Improve**:
- Dedicated technique sessions (20-30 min)
- Climb below your limit focusing on movement
- Video yourself climbing
- Watch better climbers
- Practice specific drills

**Priority Drills**:
1. Silent feet (quiet foot placement)
2. Hip turns (turning hips into wall)
3. Flagging (inside/outside flags)
4. Drop knees
5. Body positioning

### Hip & Leg Weakness
**Why It Matters**:
- Legs are stronger than arms
- Proper leg engagement reduces arm fatigue
- Critical for slab climbing
- Improves body positioning

**How to Improve**:
- Strength training (squats, lunges, single-leg work)
- Climbing drills focusing on leg engagement
- Practice high steps
- Focus on pushing with legs, not pulling with arms
- Slab climbing practice (forces leg engagement)

### Slab Climbing Weakness
**Why It Matters**:
- V10 problems often require slab skills
- Develops balance and body positioning
- Improves overall technique

**How to Improve**:
- Start with easy slab problems (V1-2)
- Focus on balance and weight distribution
- Practice smearing
- Gradually increase difficulty
- Don't avoid slab - embrace it

## Training Cycles Explained

### Base Building Phase (Weeks 1-12)
**Focus**: 
- Build foundation
- Develop technique
- Establish training habits
- Build finger strength base

**Characteristics**:
- Higher volume, moderate intensity
- Technique emphasis
- Variety of climbing styles
- Building work capacity

### Strength & Power Phase (Weeks 13-24)
**Focus**:
- Develop maximum strength
- Build power
- Project harder problems
- Refine technique

**Characteristics**:
- Higher intensity, lower volume
- Limit bouldering focus
- Hangboard intensity increases
- Power training (campus board)

### Peak Performance Phase (Weeks 25-36)
**Focus**:
- Peak strength
- Project V10 problems
- Maintain fitness
- Peak performance

**Characteristics**:
- Very high intensity, low volume
- Projecting focus
- Maintenance training
- Peak and taper

## Deload Weeks Explained

### Why Deload?
- Prevents overtraining
- Allows supercompensation (performance improvement)
- Reduces injury risk
- Maintains motivation

### What to Do During Delload
- Reduce intensity by 30-40%
- Reduce volume by 30-40%
- Focus on easy climbing
- Skip hangboard or do very light work
- Emphasize recovery (sleep, nutrition, stress management)

### When to Deload
- Every 4th week (planned)
- When feeling excessively fatigued
- When performance plateaus or decreases
- After particularly hard training blocks

## Understanding Finger Strength

### Why Finger Strength Matters
- Often the limiting factor in climbing
- Takes longest to develop (6-12 months for significant gains)
- Prevents injury when developed properly
- Allows you to hold smaller holds

### Types of Finger Strength
1. **Maximum Strength**: Ability to hold hardest holds (max hangs)
2. **Endurance**: Ability to hold holds for longer (repeaters)
3. **Power**: Ability to generate force quickly (campus board)

### How Finger Strength Develops
- **Weeks 1-4**: Neurological adaptations (better recruitment)
- **Weeks 5-12**: Tendon adaptations (stronger tendons)
- **Months 3-6**: Muscle adaptations (stronger muscles)
- **Months 6+**: Continued gradual improvements

### Patience Required
- Don't expect rapid gains
- Consistency is key
- 2x/week hangboard is sufficient
- More is not better (injury risk)

## Running & Climbing Balance

### Why Keep Running?
- Maintains cardiovascular base
- Active recovery
- Mental break from climbing
- You enjoy it (important!)

### How to Balance
- **Phase 1**: 3-4 runs/week (20-30 miles)
- **Phase 2**: 2-3 runs/week (15-20 miles)
- **Phase 3**: 1-2 runs/week (10-15 miles)

### Running Guidelines
- **Easy runs only**: No hard intervals or tempo runs
- **Recovery pace**: Should feel easy, conversational
- **Timing**: Separate from climbing when possible
- **Listen to body**: Skip if overly fatigued

## Stress Management

### Impact of Stress
- Increases cortisol (catabolic hormone)
- Interferes with recovery
- Reduces sleep quality
- Decreases performance

### Managing Startup Work Stress
- **Boundaries**: Set work boundaries when possible
- **Sleep**: Prioritize sleep (aim for 7-9 hours)
- **Recovery**: Don't skip rest days
- **Nutrition**: Eat well despite busy schedule
- **Mindfulness**: Consider meditation or breathing exercises

### Signs of Overtraining
- Persistent fatigue
- Decreased performance
- Poor sleep
- Increased injury risk
- Decreased motivation
- Irritability

### What to Do
- Take extra rest day
- Reduce training volume
- Focus on recovery (sleep, nutrition)
- Consider deload week
- Seek professional help if needed

## Goal Setting: V10 Timeline

### Realistic Expectations
- **Current**: V5-6 (V6 hit 3 times)
- **Goal**: V10
- **Gap**: 4-5 grades
- **Timeline**: 12-18 months is realistic for most climbers

### Milestones
- **Month 3**: Consistent V7 sends
- **Month 6**: V8 sends
- **Month 9**: V9 sends
- **Month 12-18**: V10 sends

### Factors Affecting Timeline
- **Consistency**: Most important factor
- **Technique**: Faster improvement = faster progress
- **Genetics**: Some people progress faster
- **Training Quality**: Better training = faster progress
- **Recovery**: Better recovery = faster progress

### Staying Motivated
- Celebrate small wins (first V7, etc.)
- Focus on process, not just outcome
- Track progress (training log)
- Stay patient
- Enjoy the journey

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Too Much Too Soon
- Don't add weight to hangboard too quickly
- Don't increase volume too rapidly
- Gradual progression prevents injury

### 2. Ignoring Technique
- Strength alone won't get you to V10
- Dedicate time to technique
- Climb below your limit focusing on movement

### 3. Skipping Recovery
- Recovery is when you get stronger
- Don't skip rest days
- Don't skip deload weeks
- Prioritize sleep

### 4. Comparing to Others
- Everyone progresses differently
- Focus on your own progress
- Your journey is unique

### 5. Neglecting Weaknesses
- Don't avoid slab because you're bad at it
- Don't avoid technique work
- Address weaknesses head-on

### 6. Overtraining
- More is not always better
- Quality over quantity
- Listen to your body

## Questions to Ask Yourself Weekly

1. **How did I feel this week?** (Energy, recovery, motivation)
2. **What went well?** (Celebrate wins)
3. **What needs improvement?** (Identify areas)
4. **Am I recovering well?** (Sleep, soreness, energy)
5. **Am I progressing?** (Grades, strength, technique)
6. **Do I need to adjust?** (Volume, intensity, focus)
