# Complete Hangboard Training Guide

## Introduction
Hangboard training is crucial for developing finger strength, which is often the limiting factor in climbing harder grades. This guide provides protocols suitable for your current level and progression path.

## Safety First

### Warning Signs to Stop Immediately
- Sharp pain in fingers, elbows, or shoulders
- Popping or cracking sounds
- Numbness or tingling
- Excessive fatigue that doesn't recover

### Prerequisites
- At least 6 months of climbing experience ✓ (You have 8 months)
- No current finger injuries
- Ability to hang body weight on 20mm edge for 10+ seconds ✓ (You can do 7 sec x 3 reps)

## Equipment Setup

### What You Need
- Hangboard with 20mm edge (standard on most boards)
- Pull-up bar or hangboard mount
- Weight belt or weight vest (for progression)
- Stopwatch or timer
- Chalk

### Proper Form
- **Shoulders**: Engaged, pulled down and back (not shrugged)
- **Core**: Tight, body straight
- **Hips**: Neutral, not sagging
- **Fingers**: Proper grip position (see grip types below)
- **Breathing**: Controlled, don't hold breath

## Grip Types

### 1. Full Crimp
- **Position**: Fingers bent at 90°, thumb over index finger
- **Use**: Maximum power, but highest injury risk
- **Training**: Use sparingly, focus on half crimp instead

### 2. Half Crimp (RECOMMENDED PRIMARY GRIP)
- **Position**: Fingers at 90°, thumb NOT over index finger
- **Use**: Balanced power and safety
- **Training**: Primary grip for most training

### 3. Open Hand / 3-Finger Drag
- **Position**: Fingers straight or slightly bent, no thumb
- **Use**: Less power but safer, good for slopers
- **Training**: Secondary grip type

### 4. Pinch
- **Position**: Thumb opposing fingers
- **Use**: Pinch holds
- **Training**: Less common, add later

## Training Protocols

### Protocol 1: Repeaters (BEGINNER - Start Here)
**Best for**: Building base finger strength, endurance

**Structure**:
- **Work**: 7 seconds on
- **Rest**: 3 seconds off
- **Reps per set**: 6 reps (total 42 seconds work)
- **Rest between sets**: 3-5 minutes
- **Sets**: 3-4 sets per grip type
- **Frequency**: 2x/week

**Progression**:
- Week 1-2: 3 sets, body weight
- Week 3-4: 4 sets, body weight
- Week 5+: Add 5 lbs, progress to 10-20 lbs

**Example Session**:
```
Warm-up: 10 min easy climbing
Hang warm-up: 2x 10 sec body weight hangs

Set 1: Half Crimp (20mm)
- 7 on / 3 off x 6 reps
- Rest 3-5 min

Set 2: Half Crimp (20mm)
- 7 on / 3 off x 6 reps
- Rest 3-5 min

Set 3: Half Crimp (20mm)
- 7 on / 3 off x 6 reps
- Rest 3-5 min

Set 4: 3-Finger Drag (20mm)
- 7 on / 3 off x 6 reps
- Rest 3-5 min

Cool-down: 5 min easy climbing
```

### Protocol 2: Max Hangs (INTERMEDIATE - Add in Phase 2)

- **Frequency**: 1-2x/week

**Progression**:
- Start with body weight + 10 lbs
- Add 5 lbs every 2-3 weeks
- Goal: Body weight + 30-50% body weight (45-75 lbs)

**Example Session**:
```
Warm-up: 10 min easy climbing
Hang warm-up: 2x 10 sec body weight hangs

Half Crimp (20mm) - Body weight + 15 lbs
- Hang 1: 10 sec
- Rest 3-5 min
- Hang 2: 10 sec
- Rest 3-5 min
- Hang 3: 10 sec
- Rest 3-5 min
- Hang 4: 10 sec
- Rest 3-5 min

3-Finger Drag (20mm) - Body weight + 10 lbs
- Hang 1: 10 sec
- Rest 3-5 min
- Hang 2: 10 sec
- Rest 3-5 min
- Hang 3: 10 sec
- Rest 3-5 min

Cool-down: 5 min easy climbing
```

### Protocol 3: Density Hangs (ADVANCED - Phase 3)
**Best for**: Advanced strength, time-efficient

**Structure**:
- **Work**: 10 seconds on
- **Rest**: 50 seconds off (1:5 work:rest ratio)
- **Sets**: 6-8 hangs
- **Intensity**: Body weight + 20-40% body weight
- **Frequency**: 1x/week

## Your Starting Protocol

### Current Assessment
- **Hanging**: 20mm full/3-finger crimp 7/3 for 10-12 reps no weight
- **Level**: Beginner-intermediate
- **Recommendation**: Start with Repeaters Protocol

### Week 1-4: Repeaters Protocol
**Tuesday & Thursday** (after easy run or on rest days)

**Session Structure**:
1. **Warm-up**: 10 min easy climbing (V0-V2)
2. **Hang warm-up**: 2x 10 sec body weight hangs on 20mm
3. **Main Set**:
   - Half Crimp (20mm): 3 sets of 6 reps (7 on/3 off)
   - Rest 3-5 min between sets
   - 3-Finger Drag (20mm): 2 sets of 6 reps (7 on/3 off)
   - Rest 3-5 min between sets
4. **Cool-down**: 5 min easy climbing

**Progression**:
- Week 1-2: Body weight only
- Week 3-4: If completing all sets easily, add 5 lbs

### Week 5-8: Advanced Repeaters
- Increase to 4 sets per grip type
- Add weight (5-10 lbs)
- Consider adding half crimp as primary grip

### Week 9-12: Introduce Max Hangs
- **Tuesday**: Max Hangs (1 session)
- **Thursday**: Repeaters (maintenance)
- Start with body weight + 10 lbs

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too Much Too Soon**: Don't add weight too quickly
2. **Poor Form**: Maintain proper shoulder/core engagement
3. **Overtraining**: Stick to 2x/week max initially
4. **Ignoring Pain**: Stop immediately if you feel pain
5. **Skipping Warm-up**: Always warm up properly
6. **Training When Tired**: Don't hangboard after limit bouldering

## Integration with Climbing Schedule

### Ideal Timing
- **Best**: Separate day from climbing (Tuesday/Thursday)
- **Acceptable**: After easy climbing session
- **Avoid**: Before or after limit bouldering

### Weekly Schedule Example
```
Monday: Climbing (technique)
Tuesday: Easy run + Hangboard
Wednesday: Climbing (limit)
Thursday: Easy run + Hangboard
Friday: Climbing (volume)
Saturday: Running + Optional climbing
Sunday: Rest
```

## Tracking Progress

### Record Every Session
- Date
- Grip type
- Weight used
- Sets completed
- Notes (how it felt, any pain, etc.)

### Monthly Testing
- Test max hang weight every 4 weeks
- Compare to previous month
- Adjust training based on progress

## Injury Prevention

### Pre-Hangboard
- Always warm up with easy climbing
- Do 2-3 light hangs before main set

### During Hangboard
- Stop if form breaks down
- Don't push through pain
- Rest adequately between sets

### Post-Hangboard
- Cool down with easy climbing
- Stretch fingers and forearms
- Consider contrast baths (hot/cold water)

### Recovery
- Don't hangboard on consecutive days
- Take deload weeks every 4 weeks
- Listen to your body

## Advanced Techniques (Phase 2-3)

### Campus Board Integration
- Start with basic ladders
- Progress to bumps and max ladders
- 1x/week max, separate from hangboard

### One-Arm Hangs
- Only attempt when you can hang body weight + 50% body weight
- Use assistance (pulley system) initially
- Advanced technique, add in Phase 3

## Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I know if I'm ready to add weight?**
A: When you can complete all sets with perfect form and it feels easy, add 5 lbs.

**Q: Should I train full crimp?**
