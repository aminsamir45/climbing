# Nutrition Guide for Climbing Performance

## Overview
As a former D3 runner transitioning to climbing, your nutritional needs are shifting from endurance-focused to strength and power-focused. This guide will help you optimize your diet for climbing performance while maintaining your running base.

## Daily Caloric Needs

### Baseline Calculation
- **Weight**: 150 lbs (68 kg)
- **Activity Level**: Very Active (6-7 training days/week)
- **Estimated TDEE**: ~2,800-3,200 calories/day

### Caloric Targets by Training Day
- **Heavy Climbing Days** (limit bouldering + strength): 3,000-3,200 calories
- **Moderate Days** (technique climbing + hangboard): 2,800-3,000 calories
- **Light Days** (running only): 2,600-2,800 calories
- **Rest Days**: 2,400-2,600 calories

## Macronutrient Breakdown

### Protein (Priority #1)

### Electrolytes
- Add electrolyte drink during/after intense sessions
- Especially important if you're also running
- Look for: sodium, potassium, magnesium

## Supplements (Optional but Beneficial)

### Recommended
1. **Protein Powder**: Convenient post-workout protein
2. **Creatine Monohydrate**: 3-5g/day (improves power output)
3. **Vitamin D**: 1,000-2,000 IU/day (bone health, especially if limited sun)

5. **Magnesium**: 200-400mg/day (muscle recovery, sleep)

### Consider If Needed
- **Multivitamin**: If diet is inconsistent
- **B-Complex**: Energy metabolism
- **Zinc**: Immune function, recovery

### Not Recommended
- Pre-workout stimulants (can interfere with sleep)
- Excessive caffeine (limit to 200-300mg/day, avoid after 2pm)

## Nutrition for Recovery

### Sleep Optimization
- **Avoid**: Large meals 2-3 hours before bed
- **Include**: Small protein snack if needed (Greek yogurt, casein protein)
- **Limit**: Caffeine after 2pm

### Stress Management
- **Include**: Magnesium-rich foods (dark leafy greens, nuts, seeds)
- **Avoid**: Excessive sugar, processed foods
- **Consider**: Adaptogens (ashwagandha, rhodiola) if stress is high

## Weight Management

### Current Weight: 150 lbs
**For Climbing Performance**: 
- **Ideal Range**: 145-155 lbs
- **Power-to-Weight Ratio**: Critical for climbing
- **Don't**: Lose weight too quickly (max 0.5-1 lb/week)

### If You Need to Lose Weight
- Reduce calories by 300-500/day
- Maintain protein intake (120-150g)
- Reduce carbs slightly, maintain training carbs
- Focus on whole foods, reduce processed foods

### If You Need to Gain Weight (Muscle)
- Add 300-500 calories/day
- Focus on protein and carbs
- Add healthy fats
- Strength training will help build muscle

## Eating Around Your Schedule

### Work Schedule: 9am-7-8pm
**Challenge**: Limited time for meals, gym closes at 10pm

**Solutions**:
1. **Meal Prep**: Prepare meals on weekends
2. **Quick Options**: Protein shakes, bars, pre-made meals
3. **Post-Gym**: Have dinner ready to eat immediately after gym
4. **Snacks**: Keep healthy snacks at work

### Sample Workday Schedule
- **7:30am**: Breakfast at home
- **10:30am**: Mid-morning snack at work
- **1:00pm**: Lunch at work (meal prep)

- **9:00pm**: Post-gym dinner (quick prep or meal prep)
- **10:30pm**: Evening snack if needed

## Foods to Emphasize

### For Finger/Tendon Health
- **Collagen**: Bone broth, collagen supplements
- **Vitamin C**: Citrus fruits, bell peppers (collagen synthesis)
- **Omega-3**: Fatty fish, walnuts, chia seeds (anti-inflammatory)
- **Protein**: Adequate protein for tendon repair

### For Energy
- **Complex Carbs**: Oats, brown rice, quinoa, sweet potatoes
- **Fruits**: Bananas, berries, apples
- **Timing**: Carbs around workouts

### For Recovery
- **Protein**: Post-workout protein for muscle repair
- **Antioxidants**: Berries, dark leafy greens, colorful vegetables
- **Hydration**: Adequate water and electrolytes

## Foods to Limit/Avoid

### Limit
- **Processed Foods**: High in sodium, low in nutrients
- **Sugary Drinks**: Empty calories, blood sugar spikes
- **Excessive Alcohol**: Interferes with recovery, sleep
- **Fried Foods**: High in unhealthy fats, low in nutrients

### Avoid (Especially Pre-Climbing)
- **High-Fat Meals**: Slow digestion, can cause discomfort
- **Excessive Fiber**: Can cause GI issues during climbing
- **Large Meals**: 1-2 hours before climbing

## Tracking & Adjustments

### What to Track
- **Weight**: Weekly (same time, same conditions)
- **Energy Levels**: Daily (scale 1-10)
- **Performance**: Climbing sessions, strength gains
- **Recovery**: Sleep quality, soreness levels

### When to Adjust
- **Low Energy**: Increase carbs, check sleep
- **Poor Recovery**: Increase protein, check sleep/stress
- **Weight Gain/Loss**: Adjust calories accordingly
- **Plateau**: Reassess macros, timing

## Quick Reference: Pre/Post Workout

### Pre-Climbing (30-60 min)
- Banana + nut butter
- Energy bar
- Small smoothie
- Oatmeal with protein

### Post-Climbing (within 60 min)
- Protein shake + banana
- Chicken + rice + vegetables
- Greek yogurt + granola + berries
- Salmon + sweet potato + vegetables

### Pre-Hangboard
- Light snack (banana, dates)
- Don't eat heavy meal 1-2 hours before

### Post-Hangboard
- Protein + carbs (shake or meal)
- Focus on recovery

## Final Tips

1. **Consistency Over Perfection**: 80% adherence is better than 100% for 1 week then quitting
2. **Listen to Your Body**: Adjust based on energy, recovery, performance
3. **Meal Prep**: Essential for busy schedule
4. **Hydration**: Often overlooked but critical
5. **Sleep**: Nutrition can't compensate for poor sleep
6. **Patience**: Results take time, stay consistent

## Questions to Consider

- Do you have any food allergies or intolerances?
- What's your current eating pattern?
- Do you meal prep or eat out frequently?
- Any dietary restrictions (vegetarian, vegan, etc.)?
- How's your current hydration?

Adjust this plan based on your answers and how your body responds!
